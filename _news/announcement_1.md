A 3rd place award in the competition on Traditional Chinese Scene Text Recognition  [3/ 123; ~2.4%]

I'm delighted to have participated in the Advanced-Level Artificial Intelligence Competition organized by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China (Taiwan) during my master's program, alongside my classmates.

We achieved the third place in the competition, which focused on scene text detection and recognition. In this competition, we had to recognize and locate correct text within challenging scenes, which often involved obscured, blurred, or skewed images !
